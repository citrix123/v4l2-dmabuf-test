-----How to run:
This program has been proved can run on intel platform (with HD4000 graphics chips).

1. Install drm library on:
	http://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/drm/
   (If you use ubuntu, you can install libdrm-dev by apt)

2. Build the program by: 
	make

3. Run the program by:
	./run.sh
   (You can also change parameter passed to program)

4. Result:
	There is an issue of DMABUF. When the format is YUYV and resolution is (160, 120), it fails to read frame.
	(You can see in run.sh, if the command is "./dmabuf-sharing -M i915 -i /dev/video0 -S 160,120 -f YUYV -b 2",
	it fails. If the command is "./dmabuf-sharing -M i915 -i /dev/video0 -S 640,480 -f YUYV -b 2" or 
	"./dmabuf-sharing -M i915 -i /dev/video0 -S 160,120 -f MJPG -b 2", it works well.)
